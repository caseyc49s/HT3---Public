# Midterm Report

__Project deliverable 2__ consists of a 4-8 page project report. It is a group assignment, therefore any one member of the team can submit.

This report should in detail explain your Minimum Viable Project (baseline solution) and it should include an evaluation of how well your solution performs on the problem you're trying to solve. The report should clearly outline the progress you have made so far, as well as the challenges you are currently facing.

Also include a link to your Github repository where you have all the code base that you have produced in your project.

  - [Repo Root](../)


Here are a few things you should include and explain in your report

#### 1. Datasets you're using

  - [Data](../Data)
  - Collisions Data _Add Link_
  - Weather Data _Add Link_
  - GIS Data _Add Link_
  - Data Description _Make .md in __Data__ folder with notes/ description of data_
  
#### 2. Data analysis / EDA results

  - [EDA](../EDA)
  - Assigned EDA areas to people
  
#### 3. Baseline models that are trained on your data you have (this might not be the best model, but should give you an idea about the next steps)

  - Pending completed EDA
  
#### 4. A link to a working prototype of your full system, preferably with an interactive UI (with backend and frontend connected). Note, this might not be the final version or have all the functionalities - include screenshots or a link to a video of a screen recording where you walk through the system

  - Pending baseling model and UI
  
#### 5. Performance evaluation. Answer the question: "Are you currently satisfied with your system's performance". Why / why not?)

  - Pending at least part 1 completion
  
#### __6. System Architecture Overview (in detail) -- if it's a system where a user interacts also outline the UX interaction flow.__

  - Priority, complete by EOW
  
#### 7. Code snippets to explain certain parts of the work done
  
#### 8. Key findings
  
#### 9. Bottlenecks / challenges

  - Datasets were not well documented
  - Idea was pending data comprehension for a while

Your project might not have all the components listed above so you are free to include others that can explain your current solution and progress. This report should give a very clear and comprehensive overview of the work you have done so far, and the next steps.



We will assess how much effort you have put in to the project, how novel your solution is (note that if you have copied code or similar, please include references, otherwise we will deduct points). We will also look at how viable your solution is and if you have understood all the aspects of theory + implementation of data systems and models that we have presented in class. Lastly, we'll also look at the quality of the submitted report and code.

This assignment is due midnight April 14th. It accounts for 10% of your final grade.
